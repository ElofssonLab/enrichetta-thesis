<h3>Conservation folder contains:</h3><br>
<strong>Conservation_entropy.py</strong> : compute gap-normalized Shannon entropy starting from multiple sequence alignment in Stockholm format<br>
properties.py : analyse the physicochemical properties for each region in the disordered proteins
cons_division.py : produce two types of division of the results: one divide the data according to the precomputed conservation score (obtained from Conservation_entropy.py); the other divide the data according to the level of conservation of the ordered/disordered regions in the protein (produce 4 groups)
